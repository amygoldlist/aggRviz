## Example_Data README

This folder contains four datasets, comprising an incomplete and aggregated fake dataset.

In this dataset, individuals were asked to provide information about the following four features:

* Their favourite dessert between cake and pie
* Their favourite colour between red and blue
* Whether they prefer Sweet or Salty snacks
* Their favourite fruit between apple and bannana

Each individual also had the option of not responding to a question.

They were then rated on four sensitive topics (topics 1 through 4).

The data was aggregated in every way possible, and in each row you will see respondents sharing up to 4 characteristics.  

Some of the data has been withheld over privacy concerns, and not all features are included in all datasets.
